## [ultrasHound - a ultrasound beacon detector](https//hackaday.io/project/25095-ushound)
### Description
Tracking ultrasound tracking  it's a device telling you in real time if there's a ultrasound beacon close to you, and ultimately to extract the payload from the beacon - but also why not being yourself a beacon to tell the indelicate listeners to gtfo !

## [PLUS: open-source toolkit for ultrasound-guided intervention systems](http//pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC4437531/)

## [Pathfinder - Haptic Navigation](https//hackaday.io/project/2372-pathfinder-haptic-navigation)
### Description
Pathfinder is a wearable device that translates distance into haptic feedback. Users just wear the wristband (or glove) and point at objects up to 500 centimeters away, and feel gentle pulses at their fingertips corresponding to the object's distance. It’s designed to give the user greater freedom of motion and longer operational range than traditional navigation solutions for the blind, such as the cane. I incorporated research ranging from embedded electronics to the neuroscience of touch to turn this simple concept into the best prototype I could, before sharing the device with my local community center for the blind.
* Some tags: sonar, blind
* Some references: https//github.com/neilmovva/pathfinder
